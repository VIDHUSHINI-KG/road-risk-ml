## 🚦 SafeX - AI-Based Road Risk Analysis & Hotspot Detection

An AI-powered road safety intelligence system that predicts real-time road risk levels and visualizes accident hotspots using Machine Learning, OpenStreetMap, and Azure Cloud.

This project works like Google Maps + Safety Intelligence Layer, helping users make safer travel decisions based on time, weather, and historical accident data.

## Key Features

📍 Place-based navigation (no latitude/longitude required)

🚦 Real-time road risk prediction (Low / Moderate / High)

⏰ Time-based risk analysis (night-time risk detection)

🌦️ Weather-based dynamic alerts

🔥 Accident hotspot heatmap visualization

🛣️ Alternate route suggestions for high-risk roads
